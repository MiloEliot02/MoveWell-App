I've created a comprehensive Flutter movement reminder app that helps users take regular breaks from their phone or desk work. Here's what the app includes:
Key Features:
üîî Smart Reminders:

Configurable reminder intervals (15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes)
Automatic detection of app usage and inactivity
Persistent reminders that adapt to user behavior

üí™ Exercise Variety:

10 different exercises including stretches, squats, push-ups, and breathing exercises
Each exercise has detailed instructions and recommended duration
Random exercise selection to keep workouts interesting

‚è±Ô∏è Interactive Exercise Timer:

Built-in countdown timer for each exercise
Visual progress bar during exercises
Options to start, skip, or snooze exercises

üìä Progress Tracking:

Tracks completed exercises and total reminders
Visual stats display with completion rates
Activity logging to reset inactivity timer

üé® User-Friendly Interface:

Clean, modern design with gradient backgrounds
Color-coded status indicators (green for active, orange for inactive)
Haptic feedback for exercise completion

How to Use:

Set Your Preferences: Choose your preferred reminder interval (15-60 minutes)
Stay Active: The app monitors your activity and shows your status
Take Breaks: When reminded, choose to start the exercise, snooze, or skip
Track Progress: Monitor your completion stats and stay motivated

Technical Implementation:

Uses Flutter's WidgetsBindingObserver to detect app lifecycle changes
Implements Timer-based inactivity detection
Provides haptic feedback for better user experience
Includes proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

To use this app, you'll need to:

Create a new Flutter project
Replace the main.dart file with this code
Add any required permissions in your platform-specific configuration files
Run the app on your device

The app will help you maintain better posture, reduce eye strain, and stay more active throughout your day!

A new Flutter project.
